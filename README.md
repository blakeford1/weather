AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

What does it do!?
I have created  weather app that allows you go get the current and future weather for any given city in the United states.
Upon searching a city name you are provided with the current date, temp, humidity, uvi, and the Cloud conditions. This is true for both the current weather and the 5 day forecast weather. In addition it will save you previous searches so you can quickly access the weather information to your favorite citys.
